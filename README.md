# json_excel_parsing

Suppose we want to write some data to excel or another spreadsheet file.
One day i was inspired and decided to implement this idea.
In my opinion not bad practice and another new skill.
# Steps:

- there is a good third-party library [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/).
- python script.
- excel program for visualization of data.
